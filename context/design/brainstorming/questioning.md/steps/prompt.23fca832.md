# prompt: Suggest a for improper error testing within the test case files of InventoryViewer and InventoryReservation. The current test case that is failing is:     await t.step(

```
  "attempting to double checkout the same item throws an error",
  async () => {
    await assertThrows(
      async () => {
        await r.checkoutItem(kerb, itemName, 1);
      },
      Error,
      `Item already checked out: ${itemName}`,
      "checkoutItem should throw when an item is already checked out",
    );
  },
);
```
