# response:

The `deno.lock` file is automatically managed by Deno. You do not manually modify it.

The only change in the provided `src/utils/database.ts` that will affect `deno.lock` is the addition of a new JSR dependency:

```typescript
import { parse } from "jsr:@std/csv"; // New import for CSV parsing
```

When you next run a Deno command that resolves dependencies (e.g., `deno run`, `deno test`, `deno cache`, or `deno check`) after adding this import, Deno will automatically:

1. Resolve the `@std/csv` package from JSR.
2. Download it (if not already cached).
3. Add its entry, including its exact version and checksum, to your `deno.lock` file.

**To update your `deno.lock` file, you should run:**

```bash
deno cache src/utils/database.ts
```

or simply run your application if `src/utils/database.ts` is part of your entry point:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env your_entry_point.ts
```

(Note: `--allow-net`, `--allow-read`, and `--allow-env` are example permissions that might be required by your application; adjust them as needed.)

**After running a Deno command, your `deno.lock` file will be automatically updated to include an entry similar to this (the exact version and integrity hash may vary):**

```json
{
  "version": "3",
  "remote": {
    "https://jsr.io/": {
      "@std/csv/": {
        "1.0.0": {
          "integrity": "sha512-..."
        }
      },
      "@std/dotenv/": {
        "0.224.0": {
          "integrity": "sha512-..."
        }
      },
      "@std/uuid/": {
        "0.224.0": {
          "integrity": "sha512-..."
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "npm": {
    "mongodb": {
      "6.8.0": {
        "integrity": "sha512-...",
        "dependencies": {
          "@mongodb-js/saslprep": "1.1.0",
          "bson": "6.8.0",
          "denoify-self": "1.0.0",
          "dns-js": "1.0.0",
          "lru-cache": "6.0.0",
          "mongodb-connection-string-url": "3.0.0",
          "saslprep": "3.0.0",
          "socks": "2.8.3"
        }
      }
    },
    // ... (other npm dependencies if any)
  }
}
```

You'll specifically see a new entry under `remote["https://jsr.io/"]["@std/csv/"]` with its resolved version and integrity hash.
