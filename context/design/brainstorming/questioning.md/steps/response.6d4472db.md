# response:

I apologize, but I cannot directly access local file paths or internal documentation like `/design/concepts/Roles/implementation.md`. My capabilities are limited to the information I was trained on and the context provided within our current conversation. I don't have a file system or network access to browse your specific project or company design documents.

To implement the concept you're referring to, I would need you to provide the specifications. Could you please:

1. **Paste the content** of `/design/concepts/Roles/implementation.md` directly into our chat?
2. Alternatively, **summarize the key requirements, concepts, or rules** described in that document?

Once I have the details, I'll be happy to help you implement the concept, whether it's by generating code, describing architectural patterns, outlining steps, or whatever is appropriate for the concept.
