# Changes
A lot of changes were made to this concept spec. For one, what permissions a Role recieved needed to be refined, as well as the concept of a Role expanded, so users could be in multiple Roles at once. Because of this, it was switched to PermissionFlags, so actions could be filtered by through multiple sources.
