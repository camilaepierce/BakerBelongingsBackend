# Reflection

## What was hard or easy?

It was easy to do the general set up of the apps, as well as implement basic concepts that are commonly used in other places. Something that was hard was how to convey a change made in the backend correctly towards the frontend, that correctly updated the functionality while not breaking any of the current action use.

## What went well?

Something that went well was creating the interactability of the app. It was fun trying to design with an array of different users in mind.

## What mistakes did you make, and how would you avoid making them in the future?

A general mistake that I made was attempting to bite off too-large chunks with the agentic coder. This ended up making designing the app even longer than if I had worked incrementally, or if I had attempted to do more pieces myself.

## What skills did you acquire and which do you feel you still need to develop further? 

Although I acquired the skill for coding using an agentic tool, it is a skill I still need to develop further. 

## How did you use the Context tool?

I used the Context tool to create the general base of concepts and structure of the app. It was helpful to keep everything consistent with the assignment specs, as well as with specs that were part of the application itself.

## How did you use an agentic coding tool? 

I used an agentic coding tool to develop the rest of the backend server, as well as rapidly develope the frontend. It was useful for iterating through updates, as well as quickly setting up the Vue app with the general structure that my application required.

## What conclusions would you draw about the appropriate role of LLMs in software development? 

My conclusion is that LLMs can be used well with difficult designs to create incremental changes, or to create a large volume of simple design. LLMs still need to take a back seat when it comes to ideation or interacting concepts, since it can be difficult to get the linking exactly as intended.
